# Panoptic Feature Pyramid Networks

**Goal** unify methods for instance and semantic segmentation at architecture level. Have a signle architecture for both tasks.

**Design Principle** start from Mask R-CNN with FPN (strong in instance segmentation), make minimal changes to generate a semantice segmentation dense-pixal output.
